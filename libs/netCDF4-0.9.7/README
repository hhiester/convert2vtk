Python/numpy interface to the netCDF version 4 library.

Quick Start
-----------

make sure numpy is installed.
make sure HDF5 and netcdf-4 are installed.
'python setup.py install' installs the netCDF4 and netcdftime modules.
The environment variables HDF5_DIR and NETCDF4_DIR can be 
set to point to the locations of the HDF5 and netcdf-4 libraries and
headers before setup.py is run. If they are not, some standard locations
will be searched. If netcdf 4.1.2 or higher is installed, the USE_NCCONFIG 
environment variable can be set in which case the nc-config utility will
be used by setup.py to determine the library and include paths.

If HDF5 was built with szip support, you may also need to set the
SZIP_DIR environment variable to point to the locations of the szip
libraries and headers.

Unit tests are in the 'test' directory.
To run all the tests, execute 'cd test; python run_all.py'.
Additional examples are in the 'examples' directory.

If you just downloaded this to your own computer, you may need to get the
version of the visit_writer.so which VisIt created or came with on your local
machine!

Also, You must have the HDF5 libraries installed on your computer, and the
netcdf-4 libraries. If c2v still complains about the netCDF module, just
reinstall the libaries from the NetCDF4 source files in the previous directory.
